# KYOCHAN_Chiral
KYOCHAN_Chiral is a standalone software for an automated analysis of stereochemical stability of dynamic chral molecules using microflow setup. Its details and benefits are described in a publication DOI:xxxxxxxx. 

**Hardware requirement**

Syringe pump: Many models of the syringe pumps are supported in KYOCHAN_Chiral. It should have a USB or RS-232 connection port. 

Temperature sensor: TC-01 (NI) is supported.

Digital output device: USB-DAQ and Compact DAQ (NI) modules are supported.

6 port valve: Valves controlled by digital input or relay contact can be used supported. 

HPLC system: Any models of HPLC system which have start signal input can be used.




**Note**
KYOCHAN_Chiral has a limited functions of KYOCHAN platform, which covers broad range of lab automation and inteligent flow chemistry. If you have interest in applications not described in DOI:xxxxxxxx, please contact to the corresponding author.
